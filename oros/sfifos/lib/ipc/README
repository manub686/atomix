The IPC module for interprocessor communication provides data transfer capability using 
either CPU copy (memcpy) or DMA copy (using the EDMA module). It uses the edma driver for
implementing DMA copy.

The IPC module provides "link abstraction" to extend a channel, where the links and channels
are defined by:


/* A "channel" is defined by the tuple (EDMA3CC_INST_NUM, chNum, chTCC, regionNum, paramNum),
 * that is, the EDMA controller module, channel number, the channel
 * transfer completion code assigned to it, the shadow region number
 * and the parameter RAM number assigned to it. These fields are also
 * maintained by the TI CSL structure for the channel object but we
 * maintain it ourselves to keep the driver API independent of the
 * CSL API. (This decision can be revisited).
 */

/* A "link" is an extension of the channel identification by attaching
 * an owner core to each channel. The owner core is the only core that
 * can use the channel (write-access), that is, set up the PaRAM, start
 * and transfer, query transfer completion and clear transfer completion
 * code. A non-owner core can only query the transfer-completion status
 * (read-only).
 */

Each buffer of a multi-core FIFO will have an associated link over which it can be copied to
its mirror buffer. This association is supposed to be static. Not every link has to use a DMA
channel resource.
