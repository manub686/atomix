BlockY  : A data consumer block with only input but no output 
BlockA  : A data transformer block with input and output both
BlockAS : A stateful data transformer block with input and output both
BlockASI: A state initializer block to assist BlockAS
BlockB  : A data transformer block with functionality inverse of BlockA
