    <configuration XML_version="1.2" description="Simulates the C6670 device which includes C66x CorePac(4x), MSMC (Multicore Shared Memory Controller), Inter-processor communication, CPINTC(3x), EDMA(3x), TIMER64(8x), VCP2(Viterbi Decoder Coprocessor)(4x), AIF2 (Antenna Interface 2), TCP3d(Turbo Decoder Coprocessor), TCP3e (Turbo Encoder Coprocessor), Semaphore2, DDR3 Memory controller and DDR3 memory, GPIO, Queue-manager Sub-system, SRIO, Network coprocessor (Packet Accelerator, Switch Sub-system), FFTC(2x) and PCIe . Does not model Power and Sleep Controller. This configuration is functional (bit accurate) . This configuration is suitable for applications development and understanding the system behavior, but doesn't support cycle accuracy at the device level. &#10; Note on other configurations available for this Device: * There is a corresponding cycle accurate configuration (C6670 Device Cycle Accurate Simulator) in the &quot;Basic Setup&quot; that can be used for applications benchmarking, but relatively slower than this configuration." id="C6670 Device Functional Simulator, Big Endian">
