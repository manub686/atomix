    <configuration XML_version="1.2" description="Simulates the TCI6618 device which includes C66x CorePac(4x), MSMC (Multicore Shared Memory Controller), Inter-processor communication, CPINTC(3x), EDMA(3x), TIMER64(8x), VCP2(Viterbi Decoder Coprocessor)(4x), AIF2 (Antenna Interface 2), RAC2(Receive Accelerator)(2x), TAC (Transmit Accelerator), TCP3d(Turbo Decoder Coprocessor), TCP3e (Turbo Encoder Coprocessor), Semaphore2, DDR3 Memory controller and DDR3 memory, GPIO, Queue-manager Sub-system, SRIO, Network coprocessor (Packet Accelerator, Switch Sub-system), and FFTC(2x). This simulator does not model PCIe Sub-system, and PSC (Power and Sleep Controller). This configuration is cycle accurate and hence suitable for applications development and benchmarking. &#10; Note on other configurations available for this Device: &#10; * There is a corresponding faster configuration (TCI6618 Device Functional Simulator) in the &quot;Basic Setup&quot;, that can be used for applications development and understanding the system behavior, but doesn't support cycle accuracy." id="TCI6618 Device Cycle Approximate Simulator, Big Endian">
