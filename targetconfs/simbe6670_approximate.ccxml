    <configuration XML_version="1.2" description="Simulates the C6670 device which includes C66x CorePac(4x), MSMC (Multicore Shared Memory Controller), Inter-processor communication, CPINTC(3x), EDMA(3x), TIMER64(8x), VCP2(Viterbi Decoder Coprocessor)(4x), AIF2 (Antenna Interface 2), TCP3d(Turbo Decoder Coprocessor), TCP3e (Turbo Encoder Coprocessor), Semaphore2, DDR3 Memory controller and DDR3 memory, GPIO, Queue-manager Sub-system, SRIO, Network coprocessor (Packet Accelerator, Switch Sub-system), and FFTC(2x). This simulator does not model PCIe Sub-system, and PSC (Power and Sleep Controller). This configuration is cycle accurate and hence suitable for applications development and benchmarking. &#10; Note on other configurations available for this Device: &#10; * There is a corresponding faster configuration (C6670 Device Functional Simulator) in the &quot;Basic Setup&quot;, that can be used for applications development and understanding the system behavior, but doesn't support cycle accuracy." id="C6670 Device Cycle Approximate Simulator, Big Endian">
